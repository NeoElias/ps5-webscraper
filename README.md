This project uses Python to scrape a Target product API URL path (in this example PS5 game console) and extracts availability information and notifies the user with an SMS using Twilio API when the product becomes available.

To run this project locally, clone the repo and run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` Note that you should have your environment set up for Python development prior to running. Additionally, you will need to set up a Twilio account to get authentication token. Instructions can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account
